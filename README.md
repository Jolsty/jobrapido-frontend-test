# Frontend assignment

This is a simple client-side (React + tailwindCSS) application that has a searchbox you can use in order to filter comments from typicode's API. It also includes a typeahead feature and pagination for the results.

## Getting Started

First, clone this repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Jolsty/jobrapido-frontend-test.git
```

Then, assuming that you have Node (`v16.14.2` or higher) and NPM (`v8.5.0` or higher) on your machine, install the packages: 

```bash
npm i
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

And finally, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
